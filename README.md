# LessFrameworks
The purpose of the Less Frameworks project is to show and example of developing Node.js applications without such tools as express.js and react.js in an effort to promote deeper knowledge among developers of the interworkings of building server-side technologies in Node as well as front-end technologies in their language of choice.

This project is not denouncing the usefulness of using well built technologies and npm packages that do heavy lifing for developers, rather the purpose is to promote those further and developer understanding by bringing along the ability to expound upon and build your own tools within the development process.
